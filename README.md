# UniTracker - Smart University Transportation Management System

Welcome to the official repository for **UniTracker**, a comprehensive university transportation management platform designed to modernize and optimize campus shuttle services. This was developed as our graduation project for the Faculty of Business Informatics at Egypt University of Informatics.

## 🚀 The Problem

University transportation systems often suffer from a lack of real-time bus schedules, overcrowding, inefficient routes, and general student dissatisfaction. UniTracker was built to solve these problems through a mobile-first, data-driven solution that benefits both students and university administrators.
