# Driver Statistics Refresh Functionality

## Overview
The driver statistics screen now includes comprehensive refresh functionality to ensure that the data displayed is always up-to-date with the database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Manual Refresh Button
- **Location**: Header section of the driver management screen
- **Functionality**: Click the refresh icon to manually reload all driver data and statistics
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows a loading spinner while refreshing
- **Accessibility**: Disabled during loading to prevent multiple simultaneous requests

### 2. Pull-to-Refresh
- **Functionality**: Pull down on the screen to refresh all data
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows a refresh indicator with the app's primary color
- **User Experience**: Intuitive gesture-based refresh mechanism

### 3. Auto-Refresh Timer
- **Frequency**: Automatically refreshes data every 30 seconds
- **Smart Logic**: Only refreshes when the screen is active and not currently loading
- **Background**: Runs in the background to keep data current

### 4. Real-time Statistics Dialog
- **Fresh Data**: Statistics dialog now fetches fresh data from the database when opened
- **Refresh Button**: Individual refresh button within the statistics dialog
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during data fetch operations

### 5. Last Updated Timestamp
- **Display**: Shows when the data was last refreshed in the header
- **Format**: "Last updated: MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm" format
- **User Awareness**: Helps users understand data freshness

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Driver Information**: Fetched from `drivers` table
- **Trip Statistics**: Calculated from `trip_history` table
- **Bus Assignments**: Mapped from `buses` table
- **Schedule Assignments**: Mapped from `schedules` table

### Refresh Methods
1. **`_loadData()`**: Main method that fetches all driver data and statistics
2. **`getDriverTripStats()`**: Fetches individual driver statistics from database
3. **Timer-based refresh**: Automatic background refresh every 30 seconds

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetch operations
- **Fallback Data**: Uses cached data when fresh data cannot be loaded

## User Benefits

1. **Real-time Data**: Always see the most current driver statistics
2. **Multiple Refresh Options**: Choose from manual, pull-to-refresh, or automatic updates
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of when data is being updated
4. **Improved Reliability**: Reduced chance of viewing stale or outdated information

## Configuration

### Auto-refresh Interval
The auto-refresh timer is currently set to 30 seconds. This can be adjusted by modifying:
```dart
_autoRefreshTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 30), (timer) {
  if (mounted && !_isLoading) {
    _loadData();
  }
});
```

### Refresh Indicators
The refresh indicators use the app's primary color scheme:
- Primary color: `Color(0xFF9C27B0)`
- Loading indicators: White with primary color accents

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
2. **Customizable Refresh Intervals**: User-configurable auto-refresh timing
3. **Selective Refresh**: Refresh only specific data sections
4. **Offline Support**: Cache data for offline viewing with sync indicators
