# UniTracker Supabase Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains the complete Supabase backend integration for the UniTracker app. The integration provides real-time data synchronization, authentication, and comprehensive API endpoints for all app features.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Database Schema**
- **users**: User profiles (students, drivers, admins)
- **routes**: Bus routes with pickup/drop locations
- **bus_stops**: Individual stops along routes
- **buses**: Bus fleet management
- **bus_locations**: Real-time bus tracking
- **reservations**: Seat reservations
- **notifications**: User notifications
- **schedules**: Bus schedules

### **Security**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Role-based access control (student, driver, admin)
- JWT-based authentication
- Real-time subscriptions with proper authorization

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### **1. Install Dependencies**

The following dependencies have been added to both apps:

```yaml
dependencies:
  supabase_flutter: ^2.8.0
  http: ^1.2.0
```

### **2. Supabase Configuration**

Configuration files created:
- `unitracker/lib/config/supabase_config.dart`
- `admin_web/lib/config/supabase_config.dart`

### **3. Run the Apps**

```bash
# For mobile app
cd unitracker
flutter pub get
flutter run

# For admin web app
cd admin_web
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

- `POST /reservations` - Create new reservation
- `PATCH /reservations/{id}` - Update reservation
- `DELETE /reservations/{id}` - Cancel reservation

### **Bus Tracking**
- `GET /bus_locations` - Get current bus locations
- `POST /bus_locations` - Update bus location (drivers)
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### **Notifications**
- `GET /notifications` - Get user notifications
- `POST /notifications` - Create notification (admin)
- `PATCH /notifications/{id}` - Mark as read

## 🧪 Testing

A test integration screen has been created at:
`unitracker/lib/test_supabase_integration.dart`

To test the integration:
1. Add the test screen to your app navigation
2. Run the connection tests
3. Verify API endpoints
4. Test authentication flow

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Row Level Security Policies**
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions
- Drivers can update their bus locations
- Public read access for routes and schedules

### **Data Validation**
- Input sanitization
- Type checking
- Business rule enforcement
- Error handling

## 📊 Real-time Subscriptions

The app uses Supabase real-time features for:
- Live bus location updates
- Instant notifications
- Reservation status changes
- Route updates

## 🎨 UI Integration

All existing UI components have been updated to:
- Show loading states during API calls
- Handle errors gracefully
- Display real data from Supabase
- Support offline functionality

## 🚀 Deployment

### **Environment Variables**
Set these in your deployment environment:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

### **Database Migrations**
All necessary tables and policies are already set up in your Supabase project.

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Efficient query patterns
- Real-time subscription management
- Caching strategies
- Optimistic updates

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure API access
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data
3. **Offline Support**: Local caching with sync on reconnection
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test all features thoroughly
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Implement offline caching
4. Add analytics and monitoring
5. Deploy to production
